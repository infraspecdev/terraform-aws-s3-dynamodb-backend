# Terraform Module for S3 and DynamoDB for Terraform State Locking

This module creates an S3 bucket and a DynamoDB table, which can be used to store Terraform state files and lock state files to prevent concurrent modifications.

## Usage

To use this module, include it in your Terraform configuration like this:

```hcl
module "tf_state_backend" {
  source = "github.com/infraspecdev/terraform-aws-s3-dynamodb-backend?ref=main"

  s3_bucket_name          = "unique-s3-bucket-name"
  dynamodb_table_name     = "unique_dynamodb_table"
  dynamodb_read_capacity  = 21
  dynamodb_write_capacity = 21
  dynamodb_table_tags = {
    Environment = "dev"
    Project     = "backend"
  }
  s3_bucket_tags = {
    Environment = "dev"
    Project     = "backend"
  }
}
